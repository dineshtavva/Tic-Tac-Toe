# Tic-Tac-Toe
This Jupyter Notebook contains an implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game for multiplayer mode. Players can enjoy a game of Tic Tac Toe directly within the notebook environment, taking turns placing their markers on the board until one player achieves a winning combination or the board is filled, resulting in a draw.
